# Feedback Integration

## Player Voice Dashboard Centralizes Player Feedback

In a playtest phase, feedback is everywhere: Discord channels, form responses, reviews, forum posts, social media messages, and QA testing feedback. Someone on the team ends up doing manual triage:

- Read hundreds of messages
- Summarize what's real vs. noise
- Guess severity
- Paste quotes into docs
- And still argue about what to fix first

**Player Voice Dashboard** centralizes the sources you choose and turns raw feedback into something you can act on **daily**.

## What You'll Get

Once you connect at least one feedback source, the dashboard helps you answer:

- **"What are players complaining about most?"** — Themes ranked by volume + urgency
- **"Where does this show up?"** — Related areas and when players mention them
- **"Give me representative quotes"** — For quick validation and team alignment

## Setup: Connect One Source to Start

You only need **one** source to begin. Add more later.
